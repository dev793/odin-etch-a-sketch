# odin-etch-a-sketch

A project to build an 'Etch-a-sketch' - a grid of squares that will change colour when the mouse hovers over them. The grid can be reset, and the density of squres changed.

This project was a good way to practice manipulating the DOM using JS, and was also a refresher on using flexbox. It was also a good exercise in researching to understand new functionality/concepts to achieve the desired outcome.

As there are many ways to solve each problem, I'm finding it challenging to understand which solutions are better, and for what reason (performace, readability, etc).

Also still getting my head around the best way to structure JS, what sorts of code to hold in functions, and also the preferred stylistic structure.
